## Next version: 0.0.1

 * Added jasmine-based tests for the Javascript code
 * Reorganize -- new top level page with Javascript, CSS, HTML (JaCH) under
   it
 * Make routes server-sensitive so I can do things like shutting down or
   restarting flask locally in testing without opening the production one
   to attacks.
 * Use flexbox instead of grid to manage the layout format so I can have
   the tools bar (github, travis, etc.) at the bottom of the browser
   window.
