# Chapter 1: Response over Prediction

Yogi Berra has been quoted as having said, "It's really hard to make
predictions, especially about the future." This is nowhere more true
than in software engineering. An approach that calls for capturing
requirements, documenting a ginormous design, followed by six months
of coding implicitly assumes that at the beginning of the project we
can predict what will be needed from the software we deliver at the
end of the project, possibly years later.

Instead, respond to change.

**Why**: "It's really hard to make
predictions, especially about the future."

**How**: In a 2014
[anti-"Agile" screed](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html)
on his blog, [http://pragdave.me/](http://pragdave.me/), Dave Thomas
outlines the following process model:

1. Find out where you are
2. Take a small step towards your goal
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
4. Repeat

When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same
value, take the path that makes future change easier.
