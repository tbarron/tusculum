# Chapter 8: Test What Matters

Make sure your tests are testing what matters.

**Why**: Tests that don't validate what you expect your code to be doing
  and flush out bugs are worthless. The whole point is to provide
  confidence that the code is behaving as expected.

**How**: Analyze your code to identify the critical aspects of its behavior
  and modularize to facilitate testing those.
