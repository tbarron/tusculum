# Chapter 2: Convention over Configuration

You _can_ set up a Python project any way you want. You may even be
able to tweak environment variables and write infrastructure support
code until something actually works. But it will be a lot easier if
you learn and use the conventions that the Python infrastructure 
already provides.

**Why**: Because if we keep reinventing the wheel, we'll never get to
  Denver.

**How**: Learn how to lay out a python project, use setup.py, distutil,
  inspect, etc. Here are some good places to start:
