I'm moving my online self once again, in the perpetual struggle to "get
organized."

I've dropped my old integrel.org domain and website that was costing about
$40 per year and not making any money, and I plan to house my personal
stuff on pythonanywhere since they'll let me have a free project -- my new
address is tusculum.pythonanywhere.com. If I ever figure out a way to
monetize anything here, maybe it will pay for a premium account on
pythonanywhere. In the meantime, I'm having fun learning flask and selenium
and javascript and jasmine and so many things.
