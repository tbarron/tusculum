I'm just realizing that doing the same operation across a lot of projects
(eg., adding github pages to each of my projects on github) is an example
of behavior that doesn't scale well. Is there some way I could specify an
operation once and have a software bot then take care of it across a
collection of entities?

Update (2017.1219): Creating and using project, module, function templates
is a way of making that sort of thing more scalable -- you do the
repetitive stuff once up front and then copy it for subsequent projects.

The only problem with that is that I've never worked out a good way of
managing templates so I can find them in the future. That sounds like the
sort of problem that might be solved by designing a system....
